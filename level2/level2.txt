1.
It's the browsers hierarchy and stands for Document Object Model.
As soon as a page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM.
It's very important to understand the DOM, while working with CSS/JS, since these two can manipulate the DOM tree.

2.
target.innerHTML = "something" <- changes an elements inner html
target.appendChild(element); <- append an element to the DOM
target.parentNode.removeChild(target); <- remove an element from the DOM

3.
It's a boolean value, which executes asynchronously in relation to page parsing.
Meaning, it will execute as soon as it's available.
Very nice to use when fetching REST Api.

4.
It's where you can find the js-file and a perfect place to debug your js code.
You can add breakpoints to your code, refresh the browser and run through your code step, by step.
If console.log(); doesn't work, this is a deeper way of debugging.
